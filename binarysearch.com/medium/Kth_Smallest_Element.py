"""
Given a list of unsorted integers nums, and an integer k, return the kth (0-indexed) smallest element in the list.

This should be done in \mathcal{O}(n)O(n) time on average.

Constraints

0 ≤ k < n ≤ 100,000 where n is the length of nums
Example 1
Input
nums = [5, 3, 8, 2, 0]
k = 2
Output
3
Explanation
When sorted the numbers are [0, 2, 3, 5, 8] and index 2's value is 3.
