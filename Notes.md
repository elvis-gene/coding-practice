# Notes

### LinkedList
- Python doesn't have a linkedlist ds

### Stack
- The list ds in Python can also act like a stack with its function pop.

### Queue
- queue is implemented in Python with dequeue (from collections import deque)

For a priority queue the element, the element with the lowest priority gets out first. In case multiple elements have the same priority, the oldest gets out first.
