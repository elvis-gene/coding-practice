## Terminologies: 
leaf, height, depth, level

Depth goes from root to the last child node. Height starts from the last child node to the root.
The height is the oppostive of depth. 

## Traversals
Trees are traversed using either DFS (Depth-first search) or BFS (Breath-first search)

### BFS
A level-order traversal.

### DFS
There are several approaches to DFS a tree:
- Pre-order   (root-left-right)
- In-order    (left-root-right)
- Post-order  (left-right-root)

### Self-balancing trees

### Red-Black Trees

### Tree rotation
A tree rotation changes the structure of a stree while keeping the same order of nodes.
